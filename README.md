# OpenCV Digital Image Processing Techniques
This repository contains various digital image processing techniques that I learned in ECE 4580. The code is implemented in Python >= 3 and OpenCV. The techniques will be used in Image Augmentation ML Project
## Honor Code @VT Warning:
You know what VT's Honor Code is, Hokies :). Don't do it. You have been warned.
## Technique One:
- Image Augmentation: https://github.com/mnguyen0226/opencv-digital-image-processing/blob/main/technique%20one/src/imageTranslation.py
- Image Shearing: https://github.com/mnguyen0226/opencv-digital-image-processing/blob/main/technique%20one/src/imageShear.py

### Result:
